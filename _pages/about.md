I am a PhD student at [Delair](https://www.delair.aero/) and [ONERA (DTIS/IVA)](https://www.onera.fr/) under the supervision of [Nicola Luminari](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicola-luminari-0a873a31/?originalSubdomain=fr), [Adrien Chan-Hon-Tong](https://www.onera.fr/en/staff/adrien-chan-hon-tong), [Bertrand Le Saux](https://blesaux.github.io/) and Guy Le Besnerais.

My main areas of research are computer vision and machine learning applied to remote sensing.

My PhD thesis aims to build interactive neural networks to enhance the synergy between human end-users and deep neural networks.
