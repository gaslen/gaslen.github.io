I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the [ECEO](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/eceo/) lab from EPFL with [Devis Tuia](https://people.epfl.ch/devis.tuia). I am working on environmental applications with deep learning and remote sensing. More specifically, I'm studying the impact of global warming on the thermal thresholds of the world's forests.

I succesfully defended my thesis in September 2022! If you're interested, you can find it on [HAL](https://theses.hal.science/tel-03814978/document).
I was a PhD student at [Alteia](https://alteia.com/) and [ONERA (DTIS/IVA)](https://www.onera.fr/) under the supervision of [Adrien Chan-Hon-Tong](https://www.onera.fr/en/staff/adrien-chan-hon-tong), [Nicola Luminari](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicola-luminari-0a873a31/?originalSubdomain=fr), [Bertrand Le Saux](https://blesaux.github.io/) and Guy Le Besnerais. During this PhD, I aimed to design interactive deep neural networks to build a collaboration between the algorithm and an user in order to efficiently collect semantic segmentation maps of remote sensing images.
