I am a PhD student at [Alteia](https://alteia.com/) and [ONERA (DTIS/IVA)](https://www.onera.fr/) under the supervision of [Adrien Chan-Hon-Tong](https://www.onera.fr/en/staff/adrien-chan-hon-tong), [Nicola Luminari](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicola-luminari-0a873a31/?originalSubdomain=fr), [Bertrand Le Saux](https://blesaux.github.io/) and Guy Le Besnerais.

My research work lies between statistics, computer vision and machine learning with applications to remote sensing.

My PhD thesis aims to design interactive deep neural networks to build a collaboration between the algorithm and an user in order to efficiently collect semantic segmentation maps of remote sensing images.
